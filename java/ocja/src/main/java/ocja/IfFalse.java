			/*
			 * Even though compiler is aware that Line n2 will never execute, but it doesn't
			 * tag it as unreachable code. Reason for this odd behavior is explained in the
			 * Java Language specification:
			 * 
			 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.21
			 * 
			 * Following statement results in a compile-time error:
			 * 
			 * while (false) { x=3; }
			 * 
			 * because the statement x=3; is not reachable; but the superficially similar
			 * case:
			 * 
			 * if (false) { x=3; }
			 * 
			 * does not result in a compile-time error. An optimizing compiler may realize
			 * that the statement x=3; will never be executed and may choose to omit the
			 * code for that statement from the generated class file, but the statement x=3;
			 * is not regarded as "unreachable" in the technical sense specified here.
			 * 
			 * 
			 * 
			 * The rationale for this differing treatment is to allow programmers to define
			 * "flag" variables such as:
			 * 
			 * 
			 * 
			 * static final boolean DEBUG = false;
			 * 
			 * and then write code such as:
			 * 
			 * 
			 * 
			 * if (DEBUG) { x=3; }
			 * 
			 * The idea is that it should be possible to change the value of DEBUG from
			 * false to true or from true to false and then compile the code correctly with
			 * no other changes to the program text.
			 * 
			 * 
			 * 
			 * Line n2 is not executed but Line n3 executes successfully and prints HELLO on
			 * to the console.
